# Tellar

Tellar is a Clojure library that makes working with deeply nested collections easier. Initially made with a motivation of reducing some of the redundancies in fixtures and tests of a project by cutting the cost of copying a large collection multiple times over for each test only to make minor modifications, Tellar helps modify deeply nested collections with the help `assoc-nth`, `assoc-all`, `dissoc-nth`, `dissoc-all`, and `update-all`.
