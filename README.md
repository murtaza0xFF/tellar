# Tellar

Tellar is Clojure library that makes working with deeply nested collections easier. Initially made to reduce some of the redundancies in fixtures and tests of a project by cutting the cost of the copying the collection multiple times over for each test with minor changes, Tellar helps modify deeply nested collections with the help of functions like `assoc-nth`, `assoc-all`, `dissoc-nth`, `dissoc-all`, and `update-all`. The function `trace` provides a trajectory for all occurrences of a given key.
